## Timing
In order to prevent last-minute submission, we have set the deadline for submitting the pull request to be at least one day before the real deadline. This can make sure that other team members have sufficient time to provide feedback on the work. 

## Communication
Slack will be our primary platform for real-time communication. In terms of  Milestone 1, we will mainly rely on asynchronous communication through Slack but we may consider scheduling meetings for future Milestones if necessary. Meanwhile, we plan to use the GitHub issue to handle bugs and tasks.
Addition for Milestone 2: meeting in person once per week after class to work on assignment in person and QA/QC.
