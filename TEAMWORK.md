## Communication
Slack will be our primary platform for real-time communication. In terms of  Milestone 1, we will mainly rely on asynchronous communication through Slack but we may consider scheduling meetings for future Milestones if necessary. Meawhile, we plan to use github issue to handle bugs and tasks.
